# Hello Everyone!

FoodExplorer is a project developed as the final challenge of the RocketSeat platform developed by me.
This application is a complete website for restaurants, where the customer can search for dishes or ingredients, add them to the cart and track their order.
As an administrator, you can also add, edit or remove dishes, upload images, among other features.

As it is not possible to create an administrator user normally, I will pass it below:

*Login*: adm@adm.com

*Password*: admin123

## Let's Start

_Instructions for starting the dev environment._

- Download the project in the github.
- Open the project folder in vsCode by dragging the folder, or, navigate through the terminal with the command "cd *folderpath*"
- Still in the console execute the command "npm install"
- Now whenever you want to start the application just run the command "npm run dev"

**Obs.:**
This project is just the frontend of the project, for the application to work correctly it is necessary to download and run the backend as well, the link is below:
